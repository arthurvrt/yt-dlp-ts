We use TypeScript with strict mode enabled, so ensure that all code follows the TypeScript strict guidelines.

When writing TypeScript code, always use `const` for variable declarations and prefer arrow functions for defining functions.

Our project wraps the `yt-dlp` CLI to simplify its usage. Make sure to provide code samples that integrate `yt-dlp` in a clean and easy-to-use way.

We use **pnpm** for package management.

We rely on **date-fns** for date manipulation, **execa** for executing commands, and **prompts** for user interactions.

The project uses **type: "module"** for ES module support and follows **ESLint** for code linting.

JavaScript code should follow the convention of using double quotes and tabs for indentation.
